# Topological Data Analysis in Neuroscience (TDA+Neuro)

## Course Description
In recent years, ideas from topological data analysis (TDA) have been increasingly adopted in order to analyze real-world data from many fields, including neuroscientific data. In this course, we will cover the fundamental ideas of TDA from the gound-up, assuming no prior knowledge of TDA. We will cover the fundamental theory of TDA on the theoretical level, but with added emphasis on working with TDA in practice via available algorithms and software. We will examine some recent literature where TDA has been applied successfully to give new insights in neuroscience. By the end of the semester, students will be able to apply concepts from TDA to analyze real-world data, and will have completed a multi-stage project in which they go through a full data analysis pipeline using TDA techniques.

More in-depth details on course topics can be found in the syllabus (link to syllabus). Communication outside of class time will function through the course gmail account, and the course Slack workspace (link to join). Exercises will be assigned via email and Slack, and updated in the [Schedule](#schedule) section below, as well as in the [Exercises](https://github.com/ndag/tda-neuro-tripods-x-2022/tree/main/Exercises) folder.

### Other Useful but non-Prerequisite Topics:
- Normal forms and Gaussian elimination: [Normal forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_normal_form) and [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination)
- Basics of graph theory: definition of a graph, connected components, see [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), [Components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)).
- Basic concepts about clustering: [Cluster analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis)

## Required Software: 
JavaPlex must be installed, and students should start running the tutorial before the first day of class. The main interface for JavaPlex is Matlab. The JavaPlex software can be found at [JavaPlex link](http://appliedtopology.github.io/javaplex/). The tutorial can be found at [JavaPlex tutorial](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex/wiki/Tutorial). Matlab can be downloaded from [Matlab website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
